=== 3.0 OBJECTIVES

This unit totally gives the life history of composers with their contribution to Music for the purpose of understanding.

<span class="s0">=== 3.1 PAIDALA GURUMURTHI SASTRI</span>

Paidala Gurumurti Sastri flourished as an eminent composer of gitas in the post Venkatamakhi period. They rank next to those of Purandara Dasa in popularity. He was a lakshyalakshana Vidwan and was referred to as “Veyigitala Paidaala Gurumurti”, i.e. one who composed thousand gitas, and ‘naluvadi vela ragala’, i.e. one who has knowledge of 40,000 ragas. Gurumurti Sastri had commendable scholarship in the Sastras and was acknowledged as one of the renowned Vaggeyakaras of his times. Further, he refers to himself as “ghana naya desya samsthapanacharya” (one who systematised the Ghana naya and desya margas) “Sastrajna” (master of the science of music), “raga bheda dhurina”, (highly proficient in the science of raga and its varieties) and “gita sastra parina”.
The composer, a Mulkinadu Telugu Brahmin, was born in Kayathar, a village in Tirunelveli district, and his house name (intiperu) was Paidaala, to which he refers in two of his gitas in Nata and Arabhi ragas” Paidaalaanvayaanka Gurumurti Saastrajnavirachitamimam” and “Paidaala vamsa jati gita sastra parina Gurumurti”.
Further biographical details of the composer are not available. He was a younger contemporary of Ramaswami Dikshtar. Even when he was quite young, he went to Madras, where he stayed for a number years and was specially honoured by Manali Chinnaya Mudaliar. His extraordinary talents won for him recognition at the hands of Tulaja Maharaja of Tanjore (1765-1787) who presented him with a palanquin.
Gurumurti Sastri was a prolific composer. He composed lakshana gitas to illustrate the characteristic feature of the form of janaka and janya ragas, giving the varja, vakra svaras, graha, nyasa and amsa svaras and so on. Earlier gitas were primarily invocations to various deities. Sastri is the earliest to attempt gitas in praise of an Acharya or guru. Of his gitas, the following may be mentioned:
S.No. Name of the Gita Raga Tala
1 Paahi Sri Ramachandra Ananda Bhairavi Dhruva
2 Gaanavidya dhurandhara Nata Dhruva
3 Bhuvanatraya- Kambhoji Dhruva
4 Sri Ramachandrapura vasa Goula Rupaka
5 Jaya Karunasindho Dhanyasi Drhuva
6 Janaki Ramana Nilambari Triputa
7 Arabhi ragalakshna Arabhi Jhampa
8 Kamsasura khandana Sahana Matya
A few of these were published with notation in ‘Gayaka Parijatam’ by Tachur Singaracharyulu in 1927.
Gurumurti Sastri had unbounded love and devotion towards his preceptor, Venkatasubbaiah, is evident from the sahitya of his gita in Nata raga’Gaana vidyadurandhara’. The first half of this gita consists of homage and praise of his guru and his extraordinary erudition in the Art of sangita. He addresses his guru thus:
My revered preceptor! Venkatasubbaiah!
Foremost amongst masters of Ganavidhya!
Born in Chinakotivamsa, may I have
Bakthi at your lotus feet
Wonderful is thy control over Nada and its intricacies,
Thy amazing skill in raga and raga varieties
Thou has the fortune of training a line of disciples,
Proficient in Gita and Prabhanda
Victory to Thee! Guru Venkatasubbaiah!
The second part of this Gita gives an account of the special accomplishments of the composer himself.
The Venkatasubbaiah referred to as guru of Paidala Gurumurti Sastri was the distinguished author of two ata tala varnams, “Nenarunchi yelukora” in Bilahari in honour of two Thulaja and “Ninnukori” in Purvikalyani. He was a junior contemporary of Pachimiriam Adiappiah and was profusely honoured by Manali Chinnaya Mudaliar. Highly proficient in sangita and sahitya, he had also composed tanas. His son, Sonti Venkataramanayya, excelled his father and has been well known as the guru of Tyagaraja.
The sahitya of the Nata gita is thus highly significant as it throws useful light on the guru of paidala Gurumurti Sastri. Besides, the piece set in Dhuruva tala has an excellent rhythmic structure. The music setting of the gita is such that it renders itself to be reckoned in the other six suladi talas, without impairing the melodic effect. The length of the piece in Dhuruva tala being 30 avartas (420 akshara kalas) varies as 42, 70,42,60,30 and 105 avartas when rendered in the Matya tala Rupaka, Jhampa, Triputa, Ata and Eka tala respectively. The simple and characteristic phrases bring out the melodic contour of the raga in bold relief.
His gitas are highly authoritative and are of great help in tracing the history of ragas. It is noteworthy that in some gitas are seen certain interesting prayogas which must have been current coin in those times, which however were replaced by more aesthetic ones subsequently. Ananda Bhairavi as pictured in his gita”Sri Ramachandra” is an instance. The usage of kakali, nishada and antaraga is not discernible here. Moreover, the pdps and sgrgm, the two key phrases in Ananda Bhairavi are gain conspicuous by their absence. Instead, pnns and sggm phrases occur more than once. The kambhoji raga gita starts on the visesha prayoga, snp, with the anya svarakakali nishada and is replete with raga bhava.
Of the sapta talas, Dhuruva, Rupaka, Truputa, Jampe and Matya are used in his gitas.
Besides, Gurumurti Sastri had also composed fine kritis in rakti ragas. Of his songs, the following may be mentioned.
 Nirajanayana-Dhanyasi-Adi
 Sabhapatim hridambhuje-Mohana-Tisra Rupaka
 Spuratute Charana nalina-Devagandhari-Adi
We can infer from the sahityas of his compositions that his “ishtadevata” was Srirama, whom he has addressed on more than one occasion endearing language. In the Goula raga gita “Sri Ramachandrapura vaasa”, he makes a fervent appeal to his personal God to bless him with greater skill in the art of music and thus fulfill the cherished ambition of his life. His songs in praise of Ramare full of emotion and are touching, since they are couched in a highly musical language. He has also sung on Kishna and Siva. The piece in Mohana Tisra Rupakam describes the beautiful dance of Siva and has an attractive chittasvara.
The sahityas of his gitas and kritis reflect a highly scholarly style (prowda) and abound in poetic excellence contributed by the presence of rhetorical embellishments like Yamaka, anuprasa and antyaprasa. His proficiency in Sanskrit with the rich vocabulary at his command is something unique. He signed his compositions with the Gurumurti mudra, which occurs generally in the last line of his gitas and in final charanam of kritis.
Paidala Subbaraya Sastri, the brother of the composer, was a brilliant singer and a composer of varnams as well. His son, Sundarayya, was also an able musician and the Devagandhari song is ascribed to him wherein the author invokes Sri Krishna to give him progeny and guru bhakti.

<span class="s0">=== 3.2 PURANDARA DASA </span>

Purandara Das was born in the year 1486 (A.D) in Purandaragada, a village in Bellary District into an affluent merchants at Purandaragad in the Pune district of Maharashtra. His parents were Kamalamba and Varadappa Nayak. His original name was Srinivasa Naik, and pet name, Seenappa. His father was a leading businessman who got his son educated by scholars.
Seenappa became proficient in Sankrit, Kannada, Music and Vedic lore. He followed his fathers foot-steps, enlarged his business of a dealer in diamonds and became so rich as to be called ‘Navakoti Narayana’.
Though rich, Seenappa was a miser until a strange incident happened in his life. God had taught him a lesson through his pious and devout wife, Saraswati whereafter he realized the futility of mere wealth, renounced earthly pleasures, distributed all his wealth to the poor and went on pilgrimage from Kanyakumari to Himalayas all the way singing devotional songs with great fervour and zeal. He and his wife became ideal Krishna bhaktas. They had three sons and a daughter.
His songs richly abound with literary flavour, devotional ecstacy, philosophical truths and thoughts of social reformation, and attracted both the learned as well as they lay.
The renowned Madhwa religious leader, Vyasaraya converted Seenappa into leading religious life to become as servant of God in 1525 (A.D.); and later, Satyadharma Tirtha, the head of the Madhwa Mutt reformed his name as ‘Purandaradas.
A natural poet he was, Purandaradas thence forth became a great teacher of the secrets of philosophy in a manner they could be understood even by the common man. Purandarada’s sweet Music was a source of immense attraction to vast concourse of people.
His daily preachings expressed his disagreement with performing Vedic rites without proper understanding and conveyed the message that God’s benevolence goes to the pure and true devotee irrespective of his caste or age.
The credit for laying a clear path for a systematic study of classical Carnatic Music goes entirely to Purandara Dasa. It was he who formulated a graded course for learning Carnatic Music, selected Mayamalaavagoula raga for preliminary exercises like Svaravalis, Janta and Datu varusas, set Alankaras to the well known Sapta talas, composed Gitas in Malahari and other ragas in praise of Vighnesvara, Lakshmi, Vishnu etc. he also composed Suladis, Thayas and Prabandhas.
Thus, he most deservedly earned the titles of ‘Karnataka Sangeetha Pithamaha’, and ‘Adi guru’.
There is a reference in one of his padas that he has composed four lakhs and seventyfive thousand padas. They are known as ‘Dasara Padagalu’.
Most of his compositions were set in the popular ragas of his time, set to simple talas like Adi, Rupaka, Chapu and Jampe. Also, Madhumadhavi, Syamakalyani, Maravi, Manjeesabhairavi were some rare ragas in which he composed songs.
His Sahitya bristles with wise sayings, appropriate figures of speech, and beautiful descriptions and is in ‘people’s language’. ‘Purandara Vittala’ is his vaggeyakara mudra.
There is a Mandap named after him in Hampi where he lived for a long time. Living for over eighty years, he took Sanyasi Asram towards the end and shed his mortal coil on the New Moon Day of the Pushya month of the year Raktakshi (January 2, 1564).
Tyagaraja, the great Vaggeyakara held Purandara Dasa in high esteem and paid glowing tribute to him in a poem.
