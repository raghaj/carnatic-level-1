== TECHNICAL TERMS

=== 1.0 OBJECTIVE

This unit gives the essential knowledge of the fundamental technical terms which are most commonly used in the field of music.

<span class="s0">=== 1.1 INTRODUCTION</span>
Music is an integral part of India’s culture.It is styled as the Gandharva Veda. It is one of the four upa Vedas (Secondary Vedas) the other three upavedas being Dhanurveda (Archery), Ayurveda (Medicine) and Artha sastra (politics).
God is conceived of as Nadabrahma-Embodiment of (Music) sound. God can be realized in diverse ways. But Sangita marga or path of Music is perhaps the pleasant way to reach him.
India is the home of the raga system.

Its Music is the finest example of a true melodic system of Music. There can possibly be only two systems of Music one in which Music progress by successions of groups of notes, called chords.
The system of Music that prevails at the present day is Desi Sangita.

This Desi sangita is of two kinds - Hindusthani and karnatic. The term Karnatic is used in the dual sence of (1) old and (2) the Southern part of the Indian Peninsula. The desi Sangita has certainly assimilated the good traits of the Marga sangita.

That which is able to please of its own accord is svara.

<span class="s0">=== 1.2.4 SAPTASVARAS</span>
The basis of all systems of Music is the seven notes or Svaras. Just as there are the seven days of the week and the seven colours of the rainbow, there are the sapta Svaras. The following table indicates Indian and western nomenclature.

<span class="s0">[</span>%header<span class="s0">,</span>format=csv<span class="s0">]</span>

7, Nishada, B, Ni, Ti
<span class="s0">|===</span>

They are found in the second century B.C in Narada’s Parivrajaka Upanishad.
The first note is named as Shadja which gives birth to other six Svaras.
The other six Svaras derive their positions only in relation to Shadja.

It will be noticed that the syllables sa ri ga ma pa dha ni are only the initial syllables of the full names of the seven Svaras, with the exception only of the first note, where sa and not sha is used.
In the case of the sixth note, it is usual to pronounce it only da while singing and not dha since the former is more euphonious. Of the seven Svaras, the notes sa and pa do not admit of varieties.

The naming of the notes rishabha, gandhara, dhaivata and nishada is associated with the crying of the animals and chirping of the birds.
The voice of the Peacock with Shadja, bull with Rishabha, the bleat of the goat with gandhara, the cry by heron to madhyama, the sound by Kokila to panchama the neigh of the horse to dhaivata, the yelling of the Elephant to Nishada.

<span class="s0">=== 1.2.5 SVARASTHANAS</span>

The remaining five Svaras: ri ga ma dha ni admit of two varieties each. The terms, komal and Tivra are used to describe these two varieties. Komal svara is the lower note and the Tivra Svara the higher note. The tivra svara is produced on the higher svarasthana and the komal svara on the next lower svarasthana. The technical names of these 12 notes together with their corresponding equivalents in western music are below.
Suddha Svaras and vikrita Svaras

The vikruta svars have prefix like chatusruti, shatsruti, sadharana, antara etc., The term suddha svara in modern South Indian Music to the lowest pitched or the earliest variety of each in the ascending scale, Thus of the three vqarieties of rishabha: Sudha, chatussruti and shatsruti, suddha rishabha is the lowest in pitch; likewise, of the three varieties of gandhara: Suddha, Sadharana and antara, sudha gandhara is the lowest in pitch and so on.
